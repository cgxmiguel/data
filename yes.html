Funny enough....i will never do this again lol. I made this for you. I won't lie, there were moments where I wanted to give up on this because it was so stressful, but I pushed myself to learn a bit of this. You mean the world to me and I want to make this year a good year for us and make things right together. I will always have a specizl place for you in my heart. I can't wait to see you again<3. t
